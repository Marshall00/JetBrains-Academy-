About
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

Learning outcomes
You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.
